# WebApplicationJava
Write a web application in Java that runs on Apache Tomcat. The application name is “cart” under the folder webapps. The application loads the data from CSV files and inserts into relevant tables. The first web page has links to next pages. In this assignment, you are required to put only one link on first page. Clicking on this link will take you next page where you have 6 links for each of these tables: Customer, Promotion, Address, Product Type, Product and Stock. 
The link asks you to upload CSV file to the server. Once the file is uploaded to the server, it opens the file and reads the contents line by line and insert all the rows into the respective table. You cannot delete any record through CSV file. You can insert new records or update existing records. If you don’t want any record to be used anymore, update it with Active = false. Product Type and Stock do not have Active field. 
CSV file names are Customer.CSV, Promotion.CSV, Address.CSV, Product Type.CSV, Product.CSV and Stock.CSV
